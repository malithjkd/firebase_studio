This error message indicates that Git is unable to authenticate with your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/malithjkd/studio.git/`) when you try to push. Here's a breakdown and how to fix it:

**Understanding the Errors:**

1.  `Missing or invalid credentials.`: This is the core problem. Git doesn't have the necessary username and password (or token) to access your repository on GitHub.
2.  `Error: connect ECONNREFUSED /tmp/vscode-git-1f116262dc.sock`: This specific error suggests that VS Code's built-in Git integration (or a related extension) is trying to use a communication channel (a socket file) that's either not running or refusing the connection. This might be interfering with how Git asks for or uses your credentials.
3.  `remote: No anonymous write access.`: GitHub confirms that you need to be logged in (authenticated) to push changes.
4.  `fatal: Authentication failed`: Git couldn't successfully authenticate.

**How to Fix It (Recommended Method: Personal Access Token):**

GitHub deprecated password authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. The standard and more secure way is to use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

**Steps:**

1.  **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:**
    *   Go to your GitHub account settings.
    *   Navigate to `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens` > `Tokens (classic)`.
    *   Click `Generate new token` (or `Generate new token (classic)`).
    *   Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "VSCode Git Access").
    *   Set an expiration date (recommended for security).
    *   Under `Select scopes`, check the `repo` scope. This grants the token permissions to access your repositories.
    *   Click `Generate token` at the bottom.
    *   **Immediately copy the generated token.** GitHub will only show it to you once. Treat it like a password.

2.  **Retry the Push Command in Your Terminal:**
    *   Go back to your terminal where your project is located.
    *   Run the push command again. **Note:** GitHub's default branch name is now often `main` instead of `master`. Check your local branch name with `git branch` and the default branch on GitHub. Adjust the command if necessary:
        ```bash
        # If your branch is 'main' (more common now)
        git push -u origin main

        # Or if your branch is indeed 'master'
        git push -u origin master
        ```
    *   When Git prompts for your **Username**, enter your GitHub username.
    *   When Git prompts for your **Password**, **paste the Personal Access Token you just generated.** (It won't show characters as you paste, this is normal).

3.  **Configure Git Credential Helper (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   To avoid entering the token every time, configure Git to use a credential helper. Git often does this automatically, but if not, you can configure it:
        ```bash
        # Example configuration (might vary slightly by OS)
        git config --global credential.helper cache # Caches for a short time
        # or use a more persistent store like Git Credential Manager (often default on Windows/macOS)
        ```
    *   The next time you push and authenticate successfully with the PAT, the credential helper should store it securely for future use.

**Alternative: SSH Authentication**

You can also set up SSH keys for authentication, which avoids passwords/tokens altogether after setup. This involves generating an SSH key pair, adding the public key to your GitHub account, and changing your remote URL to use the SSH format (`git@github.com:malithjkd/studio.git`).

**Troubleshooting the VS Code Socket Error:**

*   **Restart VS Code:** Sometimes a simple restart resolves temporary socket issues.
*   **Check VS Code Git Output:** Look at the "Git" output channel in VS Code's terminal panel for more detailed error messages.
*   **Try Pushing from an External Terminal:** If pushing from the integrated VS Code terminal fails, try opening a separate, standard terminal (like Terminal on macOS/Linux or Git Bash/Command Prompt on Windows), navigate to your project directory, and run the `git push` command from there. This bypasses potential VS Code integration issues.

Start with generating and using a Personal Access Token. This is the most common solution for HTTPS authentication failures.
